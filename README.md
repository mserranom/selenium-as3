# Flash Selenium Connector

**Flash Selenium Connector** enables communication between [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) and Adobe Flash applications running in a browser. 

Basic features are:

* Search for flash elements using Seleniumâ€™s findElement-like interfaces
* Add [explicit waits](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp) for a certain conditions, such as an element being added to stage or a text field being set a particular value.
